#### Lyrics
```
Let's start at the very beginning.
A very good place to start.
When you read you begin with? ABC. When you sing you begin with do-re-mi.
Do-re-mi, do-re-mi, the first three notes just happened to be do-re-mi.
Do-re-mi.
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti. Well, let's see if I can make it easier.
Doe, a deer, a female deer.
Ray, a drop of golden sun.
Me, a name I call myself.
Far, a long, long way to run.
Sew, a needle pulling thread.
La, a note to follow so.
Tea, a drink with jam and bread.
That will bring us back to do, oh, oh, oh.
Do! a deer, a female deer.
Re! a drop of golden sun.
Mi! a name I call myself.
Fa! a long, long way to run.
So! a needle pulling thread.
La! a note to follow so.
Ti! a drink with jam and bread.
That will bring us back to do.
A deer, a female deer.
Ray, a drop of golden sun.
Me, a name I call myself.
Far, a long, long way to run.
Sew, a needle pulling thread.
La, a note to follow so.
Tea, a drink with jam and bread.
And that will bring us back to do.
Do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, do! So do!
```
